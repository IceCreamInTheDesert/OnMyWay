I couldn't find any apps for people affected by dementia to help themselves get home, so I created an app to help call and go home. 
There are also lockscren widgets that display information like postal code, name, and phone number, in case the password is forgotten.
It's still not perfect. It does work, but I think I can make some improvements...
